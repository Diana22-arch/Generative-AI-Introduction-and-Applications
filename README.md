  * Examples: Spam detection, facial recognition

### **Core Capabilities Explored**

* **Text Generation**

  * Tools: GPT-3, GPT-4
  * Applications: Writing assistants, chatbots, documentation
* **Image Generation**

  * Tools: Midjourney, DALL·E
  * Applications: Digital design, advertising
* **Code Generation**

  * Tools: GitHub Copilot
  * Applications: Autocompletion, code templates, debugging
* **Speech & Audio**

  * Tools: Text-to-speech models
  * Applications: Accessibility, content narration
* **Video Generation**

  * Tools: Runway ML, Synthesis
  * Applications: Marketing, education, automated media
